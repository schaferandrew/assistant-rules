# Docker Compose: Run in Foreground

When suggesting `docker compose up` for the backend API (or other services in this project), **do not use `-d`**.

- Use: `docker compose up api` (or `docker compose up` for all services)
- Avoid: `docker compose up -d api`

The user wants to run containers in the foreground so logs stream in the terminal and they can stop with Ctrl+C.
